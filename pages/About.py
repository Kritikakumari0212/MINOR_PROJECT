st.markdown("### ðŸŒŸ Introduction\n\nThe Energy Consumption Analysis app presents visualizations of energy generation and consumption patterns. Users can explore insights from the data, including the generation trends for fossil gas, fossil oil, and nuclear energy, as well as the proportion of forecasted load vs. actual load and the distribution of fossil fuel generation over time. Interactive pie charts showcase the proportions of various renewable energy sources, while histograms and area charts depict the generation trends for fossil hard coal, solar, and nuclear energy.")

# Proportion of Fossil Fuel Generation
st.subheader('Proportion of Fossil Fuel Generation')
st.markdown("ðŸ“Š This pie chart presents the proportion of fossil fuel generation compared to other energy sources. It shows the percentage of total generation that comes from fossil fuels, including brown coal/lignite, hard coal, and gas. The largest segment of the pie represents the highest percentage of fossil fuel generation, while the other segments show the respective percentages of the other energy sources.")

# Interactive Pie Charts - Energy Generation Proportions
st.subheader('Interactive Pie Charts - Energy Generation Proportions')
st.markdown("ðŸ“Š These interactive pie charts show the proportion of generation from various renewable energy sources. Users can explore the percentages for geothermal, hydro, marine, solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources. The largest segment of each pie chart represents the highest percentage of generation for that specific renewable source.")

# Histogram for Fossil Gas Generation
st.subheader('Fossil Gas Generation')
st.markdown("ðŸ“Š This histogram displays the frequency distribution of fossil gas generation in MW. The x-axis represents the generation levels, while the y-axis shows the frequency (number of occurrences) of each generation level.
